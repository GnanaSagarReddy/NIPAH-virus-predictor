# Nipah Virus Predictor

## Introduction

Nipah Virus Predictor is a machine learning project that aims to predict the likelihood of a person having the Nipah virus based on reported symptoms. The project leverages a dataset containing information about individuals with or without the Nipah virus, including symptoms such as fever, body pains, fatigue, sore throat, breathing difficulty, and cough.

## Features

- Predicts the likelihood of Nipah virus based on reported symptoms.
- Uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and classify input data.
- Provides an easy-to-use interface for users to input symptoms and receive predictions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset containing information about individuals with or without the Nipah virus. The dataset includes the following features:

- Fever
- Body pains
- Fatigue
- Sore throat
- Breathing difficulty
- Cough

## Machine Learning Model

The machine learning model employed in this project is based on Logistic Regression. The model has been trained on the provided dataset to predict the presence of the Nipah virus based on the reported symptoms.
